# Reinforcement Learning Based Optimization in a Discrete Event Simulation Environment for Optimal Job Assignment in Workflow Processes

Implementation of different policies for optimal role resolution.

Included policies:

1. LLQP
2. SQ
3. K-Batch
4. K-Batch-1
5. 1-Batch-1

For solving the optimization problem present in the batching policies, the [Gurobi Optimization](http://www.gurobi.com) suite was used.

For the reinforcement learning environment all algorithms are based on the new draft of Sutton and Barto's book [2017 Version](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/bookdraft2016sep.pdf).
