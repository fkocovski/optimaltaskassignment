# Discrete Event Simulation for Optimal Role Resolution in Workflow Processes

Implementation of different policies for optimal role resolution.

Included policies:

1. MMC
2. MM1
3. LLQP
4. SQ
5. KBatch
6. KBatch1

For solving the optimization problem present in the batching policies, the [Gurobi Optimization] (http://www.gurobi.com) suite was used
